        Wayanad, the green paradise is nestled among the mountains of the Western Ghats, forming the border world of the greener part of Kerala. Clean and pristine, enchanting and hypnotizing, this land is filled with history and culture. Located at a distance
        of 76 km. from wayanadthe sea shores of Kozhikode, this verdant hill station is full of plantations, forests and wildlife. Wayanad hills are contiguous to Mudumalai in Tamil Nadu and Bandhipur in Karnataka, thus forming a vast land mass for the
        wild life to move about in their most natural abode. Wayanad is unique in that it is situated in an elevated picturesque mountainous plateau in the Western Ghats. The vast stretches of mist - capped mountains, green meadows of valleys, white water
        springs, blue water lakes and wild forests express the splendid natural beauty of Wayanad. Its pretty image not withstanding, perhaps what the visitor finds most endearing about this quaint little hill station is its large tribal population of
        about fifty-strong tribes and their fascinating lifestyle. Travellers can stay at the tree top houses and mud huts and enjoy the thrills of jungle life.
